# rockpaperscissors

Goal: To make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”.

Pre-project thoughts: I think this project should adequately test my understanding of Javascript and functions that I have at the moment.

Post-project thoughts: Wow, that was a pretty big and interesting project for me! Really learnt alot about javascript in general and DOM. Really helpful links were the video by freeCodeCamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0&t=4685s and also by peeking at emilravn's solution when I got stuck trying to figure out how to wipe away the buttons and restarting the game after it reached 5 on the player/comp. Overall, a very enjoyable project.
